This is a beginner Web App using a single-page HTML file, integrating easy JavaScript functions and styled with CSS.

Using CSS, one of the critical designs I experimented with was the opacity gradient, which overlayed across the hero image, increasing the visibility of the text.

The website is media-responsive, readjusting the placement of icons and text to the appropriate screen size.

Another nifty feature is the horizontal media scroller repeated across the page. This was also done entirely using CSS. It was developed from scratch with a lot of trial and error, and is now fully functioning.

JavaScript is used for the pop-up on load, as well as the 'Back to Top' button.
